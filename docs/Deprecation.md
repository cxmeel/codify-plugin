# Deprecation Notice

Codify v2 is now archived and no longer being maintained. **Codify3** is in development and will supersede this version.

The README for Codify v2 will be updated to encourage users to upgrade to Codify3 and provide relevant links when Codify3 becomes available.

## Why?

Roactify (the original name for Codify) was built by a single developer ([@cxmeel](https://github.com/cxmeel)), and thanks to the Roblox community and the open source nature of the project, it has grown beyond what I could have originally imagined.

However, due to the open source nature and the many contributors, I have found it difficult to charge for the product. It always seemed unfair to charge for something that was built by so many people, and I didn't want to charge for something that I didn't build myself.

Because Codify has been freely available outside of the Roblox Creator Marketplace, Codify has accumulated thousands of downloads and regular users, but only a minute handful of physical sales **(less than 1%)**.

I have decided to start from scratch and build a new version of Codify that will be easier to maintain and monetize. I will be taking the lessons I've learned from Codify v2 and applying them to Codify3 to deliver a better product and a better experience for everyone.

## What's new in Codify3?

Codify3 will be a complete rewrite of Codify v2. It will be built from the ground up to be more performant, more stable and more feature-rich. It will also be easier to maintain and update, which will allow me to provide better support and improve the product over time.

Codify3 will be a paid product, but it will be priced fairly and competitively. I will also explore the possibility of a free version with limited features, but no guarantees on that.

There's no set timeline for Codify3, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.

## What does this mean for me?

**If you have purchased Codify v2**, you will still be able to use it. When Codify3 releases, you will be able to upgrade for free via the Plugin Management window or via Itch.io, depending on where you purchased Codify.

**If you have not purchased Codify v2**, you will not receive any further updates, patches or bug fixes. You will still be able to use Codify v2 in its current state, but I will not be providing any support for it. If you wish to install Codify v2, you can do so by compiling the source code yourself.

:sparkling_heart: **Thank you** to everyone who has supported Codify v2. I hope you will continue to support me and Codify3.
